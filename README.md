# hi-agent

A reference implementation of the [human-interface](../human-interface/docs/human-interface.md) spec — a small Rust agent that talks over HTTP channels, delegates cognition to a Claude Code runtime (installed on first run) over ACP, and persists everything to JSONL.

## Status

design v0.1 · 2026-05-28 · v0 implementation complete · not load-tested.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (2024 edition — `rustc` 1.85 or newer)
- hi-agent prefers the runtime your system already offers: if `node`, the ACP
  adapter (`claude-agent-acp`), and the `claude` CLI are all on your `PATH`, it
  uses them directly and downloads nothing. Installing those tools globally is
  also how you point hi-agent at your own runtime (e.g. to develop offline).
- If the system doesn't offer the full set, hi-agent falls back to a
  self-contained install: on first run it downloads the pinned Node and `npm ci`s
  the ACP adapter + `claude` CLI into an OS cache dir, then reuses that install on
  every subsequent start. That first run needs network access and the system
  `tar`; later runs are offline. macOS and Linux on x86_64/aarch64 are supported
  for auto-install.

### Build and run

```sh
# 1. build the SPA so rust-embed has something to embed
cd src/appearance/web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ../../..

# 2. build the Rust binary
cargo build --release

# 3. start the agent (creates ./data on first run)
./target/release/hi-agent
```

Or, with `make`:

```sh
make build && make run
```

### Verify it's alive

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/thought \
  -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' \
  --data-binary 'hello'
```

You should see `202 Accepted` and a fresh line in `data/journal.jsonl`. To watch the agent talk back, open a long-poll in another terminal first:

```sh
curl -N -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' http://127.0.0.1:8080/thought
```

## Curl recipes

The most useful four:

```sh
# Open a long-poll on /thought for scene alice@phone (Ctrl-C to close)
curl -N -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' http://127.0.0.1:8080/thought

# Send a thought
curl -X POST -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' \
  --data-binary 'hey, are you there?' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/thought

# Schedule a reminder (the router decides whether to call set_intent)
curl -X POST -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' \
  --data-binary 'remind me at 21:00 to call mom' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/thought

# Approve a pending action (id comes from the /approval long-poll JSON)
curl -X POST -H 'X-HI-Scene: alice@phone' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id":"<approval-uuid>","allow":true}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/approval
```

## Architecture

One Rust process per agent. Inside it: an axum HTTP server, a reactor that owns per-scene queues and a worker registry, a memory facade backed by two JSONL files, an in-process MCP hub the router/worker sessions reach over a Unix socket, and a heartbeat that injects synthetic signals when intents come due. Cognition is delegated: on first run hi-agent installs its runtime (downloading the pinned Node and `npm ci`-ing the ACP adapter + `claude` CLI into an OS cache dir), then on every start spawns the ACP adapter (via that `node`) and creates one fresh ACP session per routing turn (and one per long-lived worker). The adapter talks to a local Anthropic-compatible proxy that injects the real upstream credential, so the key never lands in any on-disk adapter config.

## Spec compliance (v0)

| Spec requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /` homepage | Y | Embedded Vite SPA, OG meta injected at request time |
| `POST /thought` | Y | Body bytes are the signal; close-of-body ends the utterance; `X-HI-Scene` names the scene (defaults to anonymous when absent) |
| `GET /thought` long-poll | Y | `X-HI-Scene` names the scene to receive on (400 if absent); per-scene buffered delivery from the reactor |
| `POST /approval` | Y | JSON `{id, allow, reason?}`; reactor relays decision into ACP `session/request_permission` |
| `GET /approval` long-poll | Y | JSON event; 5-minute timeout on the requesting side |
| `POST /vision` | 501 | Per v0 scope; body describes the omission |
| `POST /audio`, `GET /audio` | Y when configured | STT transcribes the body and routes the text; the router may reply via `speak(channel="audio")` which is synthesized back through TTS and broadcast on the long-poll. 501 on POST when `STT_PROVIDER` is unset. |
| `POST /touch`, `POST /smell`, `POST /taste` | 501 | Per v0 scope |
| Per-scene routing | Y | One ACP session per routing turn, scoped by `X-HI-Scene` |
| Workers (parallel ACP sessions) | Y | `spawn_worker` MCP tool; one session per worker; auto-stamp `X-HI-Scene` |
| Memory: `journal.jsonl` + `intents.jsonl` | Y | Append-only journal; intents file rewritten atomically on add/remove |
| Heartbeat (1 Hz, absolute intents) | Y | Synthetic `signal_in` on `channel: intent`, injected via the reactor |
| `X-HI-Scene` recorded | Y | Journaled before dispatch; defaults to anonymous when absent |
| `Authorization: Bearer ...` | accepted/logged | Parsed and logged; not validated in v0 |
| Cron / relative intents | deferred | Per `docs/impl.md` Scope |
| Forgetting curve / significance / compaction | deferred | Per `docs/impl.md` Scope |
| Federation / e2e encryption / handle discovery | deferred | Per `docs/impl.md` Scope |

## Configuration

Env vars consulted at startup:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_API_KEY` | — | Upstream LLM credential, injected by the local proxy. Required; read from env only, never written to disk. |
| `AI_API_BASE` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Upstream LLM base URL the proxy forwards to. |
| `HI_AGENT_CONFIG` | `config.toml` | Path to the dev-managed config file (model / effort / permission mode) |
| `HI_AGENT_RUNTIME_DIR` | OS cache dir | Override the dir the runtime is installed into |
| `HI_AGENT_MCP_SOCK` | `<data_dir>/mcp.sock` | Unix socket the MCP hub listens on |
| `HI_AGENT_SHIM_BIN` | `current_exe()` | Program to re-exec as the MCP stdio↔socket shim |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Standard `tracing-subscriber` env filter |

Managed cognition parameters (model, effort, permission mode) live in
[`config.toml`](config.toml), not in env vars; the upstream credential and base
URL come from `AI_API_KEY` / `AI_API_BASE`. To use your own runtime (or to skip
the first-run download), put `node`, `claude-agent-acp`, and `claude` on your
`PATH` — hi-agent detects and uses them automatically.

### Runtime install & versioning

The Node and ACP adapter versions are pinned in
[`src/runtime/manifest.toml`](src/runtime/manifest.toml); the adapter +
`claude` CLI dependency tree is pinned by the committed
[`src/runtime/package.json`](src/runtime/package.json) /
[`src/runtime/package-lock.json`](src/runtime/package-lock.json). On first run hi-agent
downloads the pinned Node release from nodejs.org (extracted with the system
`tar`) and runs `npm ci --omit=dev` against the committed lockfile into an OS
cache dir, marks the install complete, and reuses it on every later start.
`build.rs` stamps the pinned versions into the binary; `hi-agent --version`
reports the crate version alongside the runtime component versions (bundle id,
node, adapter, claude).

### Voice (optional, additive)

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are independent capabilities. Each is off by
default; enabling either is a one-provider switch. Both happen to use
Volcengine in this release; swapping either is a single file under
`src/voice/`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STT_PROVIDER` | `none` | `none` → `POST /audio` returns 501. `volcengine` → enable transcription. |
| `TTS_PROVIDER` | `none` | `none` → `speak(channel="audio")` returns an error string (the agent retries with text). `volcengine` → enable synthesis. |
| `VOLCENGINE_STT_APPID`, `VOLCENGINE_STT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | — | Required when `STT_PROVIDER=volcengine` |
| `VOLCENGINE_STT_CLUSTER`, `VOLCENGINE_STT_MODEL` | sensible defaults | Optional STT tuning |
| `VOLCENGINE_TTS_APPID`, `VOLCENGINE_TTS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | — | Required when `TTS_PROVIDER=volcengine` |
| `VOLCENGINE_TTS_CLUSTER`, `VOLCENGINE_TTS_VOICE`, `VOLCENGINE_TTS_ENCODING` | sensible defaults | Optional TTS tuning |

STT and TTS having separate credentials is deliberate — each capability is
self-contained, so one can be moved to a different provider without touching
the other.

CLI flags:

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--port` | `8080` | HTTP port to bind |
| `--data-dir` | `./data` | Where `journal.jsonl` / `intents.jsonl` / `mcp.sock` live |

## Development

Two processes — the Rust binary on `:8080` and the Vite dev server on `:5173`, with Vite proxying channel routes to `:8080`:

```sh
make dev
```

(That backgrounds `cargo watch` and `npm run dev` with a `trap` so Ctrl-C stops both. Output from the two processes is interleaved without prefixes — if that bothers you, run them in separate terminals.)

The browser talks to `:5173`. HMR works for the SPA; Rust reloads on file change via `cargo watch`.

## Docker

```sh
docker build -t hi-agent:dev .
```

On first run the binary installs its own runtime (downloads the pinned Node and
`npm ci`s the ACP adapter + `claude` CLI into a cache dir), so the image needs
no separate claude-code container. First run therefore needs network access and
the system `tar`. The image still needs `AI_API_KEY` supplied at
runtime for cognition to work.

## Risks and known unverified things

See [`docs/risks.md`](docs/risks.md). The headline item: concurrent ACP sessions in the Claude Code runtime have not been measured under load. Validate the concurrency assumption (drive concurrent thoughts from several scenes and compare wall-clock) before trusting the architecture in production.
